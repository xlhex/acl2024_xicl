Premise: George Jacob Gershwin ( ; September 26, 1898 July 11, 1937) was an American composer and pianist. Gershwin's compositions spanned both popular and classical genres, and his most popular melodies are widely known. Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions "Rhapsody in Blue" (1924) and "An American in Paris" (1928) as well as the opera "Porgy and Bess" (1935).
Hypothesis: Porgy and Bess was composed in the 1900s.
Reason: The hypothesis accurately reflects the information provided in the premise. The premise states that George Gershwin composed "Porgy and Bess," and the hypothesis states that it was composed in the 1900s. Since "Porgy and Bess" was composed in 1935, which falls within the 1900s, the hypothesis is true based on the information given in the premise. Therefore, the label "entailment" is appropriate for this example.

It does not provide any specific information or context related to voting rights, thereby resulting in a neutral label.
Label: neutral

This hypothesis does not directly contradict the information in the premise, but it also does not provide any additional information or confirmation. Therefore, the label "neutral" indicates that the hypothesis does not strongly support or oppose the premise.
Label: neutral
