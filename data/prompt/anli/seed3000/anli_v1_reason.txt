Reason: It says the album *contains* cover songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Vinícius de Moraes, Marcos Valle, and Luiz Bonfá, not whether or not these were the only ones. The system probably did not recognize "in addition to".

Hypothesis: The 1988-89 Iraq FA Cup was the only tournament Al-Tayaran was beat in.
Reason: my statement is neither definitely correct nor definitely incorrect because although he lost, it is possible that in his lifetime he was beaten in another competition. I think it was difficult for the system because I used words that were not in the context such as "only".

Like "Spy Troops", the film was written around the theme of the toys released that year. In this case, it was Valor vs. Venom which introduced a new villain group, Cobra’s V-Troops.
