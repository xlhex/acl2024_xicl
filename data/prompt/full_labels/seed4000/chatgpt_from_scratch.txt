Premise: The lights at night in the city.
Hypothesis: The city is dark because of a blackout.
Reason: The hypothesis ("The city is dark because of a blackout") contradicts the premise ("The lights at night in the city").

Premise: Men playing a sport during a sunny day.
Hypothesis: Men play some volleyball on a beach.
