Premise: A male rock climber grips a large crack on the side of a ledge.
Hypothesis: A man is at the mall.
Reason: The premise describes a male rock climber gripping a large crack on the side of a ledge, which indicates that he is engaged in a rock climbing activity.

Premise: Man in business attire speaks into a microphone.
Hypothesis: A businessman is giving a speech.
Reason: The image of a man in business attire speaking into a microphone is consistent with a businessman giving a speech.

Label: neutral
